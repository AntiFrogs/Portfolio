# Portfolio

Simple portfolio to show case my resume 

Check the Live Demo depolyed on [Github pages](https://antifrogs.github.io/Portfolio/)  

## How It's Made:
**Tech Used:** Javascript , CSS , Html 
<br />
<br />
This is a simple portfolio using only html , css and js. there is no libary or framework used in the source code. all the logic , styles and the html code are seprated into three files. The structure of the project simple and all the static data needed by the app is present.  

## What's left:

The whole thing should probably be implemented in a component-based approach. Some features like fading in as user scrolls can be implemented better using related libaries. The structure od the code could be improved by having multiple style files (each for the related part of the app).


## How to run:
This is a simple html file. either run this in your local host or use live servers (e.g. the live server extension is available on vs code)
